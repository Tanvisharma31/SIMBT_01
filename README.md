## Installation

## Usage

1. **Basic Usage:**

   To perform a simple web scrape, use the following command:

   ```bash
   web-scraper scrape my_config.json
   ```

   Replace `my_config.json` with your configuration file containing scraping instructions.

2. **Configuration:**

   Create a JSON configuration file that defines the scraping parameters. Here's an example:

   ```json
   {
     "url": "https://example.com",
     "selectors": {
       "title": "h1",
       "content": ".article-content"
     }
   }
   ```

   - `"url"`: The URL of the website you want to scrape.
   - `"selectors"`: Define the elements you want to extract.

3. **Export Data:**

   You can export the scraped data to a file. For example, to export data to a CSV file, use the following command:

   ```bash
   web-scraper scrape my_config.json --output data.csv
   ```

4. **Automation:**

   You can schedule and automate scraping tasks using cron jobs or other scheduling tools.
